#  What is Danger Zone?

Danger Zone is a new game mode in the popular first-person shooter game, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. It was released on April 21, 2017, as part of the game's Operation Hydra update.

In Danger Zone, players are placed in a virtual arena with limited supplies. The objective is to be the last player alive by killing other players and collecting their supplies. Players can also win by escaping the Danger Zone altogether.
