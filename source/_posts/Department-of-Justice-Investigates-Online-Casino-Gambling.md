#  Department of Justice Investigates Online Casino Gambling

On October 10, 2018, the Department of Justice unsealed an indictment against two Russian intelligence officers and two Russian nationals for allegedly conducting illegal online gambling operations. The indictment alleges that the defendants used two websites—one of which was a front company for the GRU, Russia’s military intelligence service—to trick casinos into wiring over $100 million to bank accounts in Cyprus and Latvia.

According to Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the defendants “used sophisticated cyber techniques to hide their identities and conceal the ownership and control of the websites.” They also allegedly took steps to prevent casino customers from withdrawing their winnings, including by disabling account functions and placing limits on how much money could be withdrawn at any given time.

This is not the first time that the Department of Justice has investigated allegations of illegal online gambling. In 2013, then-Attorney General Eric Holder announced charges against 11 individuals affiliated with three offshore sports betting websites. And in 2016, the department reached a settlement with Absolute Poker and Ultimate Bet, two major online poker companies, over allegations that they had violated federal law by allowing U.S. players to bet on their websites.

So what is it about online gambling that makes it a target for federal scrutiny? And why do authorities seem to be particularly concerned about activities that take place outside of the United States?

The legal status of online gambling is murky, as it falls into a gray area between state and federal law. The Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act (UIGEA), which was passed in 2006, prohibits financial institutions from processing transactions related to illegal gambling activities. But this act does not specifically address online gambling itself, leaving it up to individual states to decide whether or not to allow it.

As a result, there are currently no federal laws that expressly prohibit Americans from engaging in online gambling transactions. However, some states have passed laws banning certain types of online gambling, while others have taken a more laissez-faire approach. And last year, the Supreme Court struck down a federal law that prohibited state-licensed sports betting businesses from operating in other states. This decision could pave the way for broader legalization of online casino gambling in the United States.

So why is the Department of Justice taking an interest in these activities? One possible explanation is that officials are concerned about potential money laundering and terrorist financing risks associated with online gambling operations. Casino games can be used as a tool for criminals to launder money or finance terrorist activities, and authorities may be keen on preventing these activities from taking place on U.S.-based websites.

Another possibility is that officials are concerned about the effects of legalized online gambling on brick-and-mortar casinos. There is some evidence that legalized online gambling can cannibalize revenue from traditional casinos, as consumers shift their spending to internet-based platforms. This could lead to job losses and other negative economic consequences in communities where casinos are located.

Whatever the reasons may be, it seems clear that the Department of Justice is closely watching developments in the world of online casino gambling—and those involved in this industry should take note.

#  Treasury Department Moves to Shut Down Illegal Online Gambling Operations

WASHINGTON, D.C. - The Treasury Department announced plans to shut down illegal online gambling operations on Thursday, saying that the activity violates federal law and harms consumers.

"Illegal online gambling is a grave threat to consumers and our economy," said Secretary Steven Mnuchin in a statement. "It deprives states of critical tax revenue, and we will not tolerate it."

The Treasury Department says it will work with other federal agencies to shut down illegal online gambling operations, which are believed to have caused more than $10 billion in losses since 2006.

Consumer advocates applauded the move, saying that it would help protect people from being scammed or addicted to gambling.

#  FBI Cracks Down on Illegal Online Casino Gambling

The FBI has announced a new crackdown on illegal online casino gambling, which is estimated to generate over $10 billion in annual revenue.

Agents are working with leading online casinos to identify and shut down illegal operations, which often use deceptive practices to lure customers.

"Illegal online casinos pose a significant threat to the public," said FBI Director James Comey. "They can steal your money, your identity, and damage your computer."

The FBI is also working with state and local law enforcement agencies to prosecute those involved in illegal online casino gambling.

#  Congress Proposes Legislation to Regulate and Tax Online Casino Gambling

In a bipartisan effort, Senators Chuck Schumer (D-NY) and Ron Wyden (D-OR) have jointly proposed the Restoration of America’s Wire Act (RAWA), a bill that would federally regulate and tax online casino gambling in the United States. The reintroduction of RAWA would overturn the 2011 Department of Justice opinion that allowed states to legalize and regulate online casino gambling within their borders.

Under RAWA, online casino gambling would be treated like any other form of gambling, such as casinos and lotteries. Online casinos would be required to obtain a license from the Federal Gaming Commission and pay a 15% tax on their gross gaming revenue. The bill would also allow states to continue to legalize and regulate online casino gambling within their borders.

The reintroduction of RAWA has been met with criticism from both the gaming industry and anti-gambling advocates. The gaming industry argues that RAWA is a job-killer that will result in the closure of many small businesses. Anti-gambling advocates argue that RAWA will lead to an increase in problem gambling.

Despite the opposition, it is likely that RAWA will pass both the House and Senate. Republicans are generally in favor of regulation, while Democrats are generally in favor of taxation.

#  Federal Court Rules that Internet Gambling is Illegal

On Friday, May 15, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit issued a ruling that internet gambling is illegal under federal law. The decision came in response to a lawsuit filed by the Department of Justice (DOJ) in 2012 seeking to shut down two online poker companies, PokerStars and Full Tilt Poker.

The DOJ argued that the companies were operating in violation of the Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act of 2006 (UIGEA), which prohibits banks and other financial institutions from processing payments for online gambling transactions. PokerStars and Full Tilt Poker countered that their operations fell within a legal exemption for games of skill set out in the UIGEA.

In its ruling, the Third Circuit sided with the DOJ, finding that poker is not a game of skill but rather a game of chance. As such, it constitutes illegal gambling under federal law. The court rejected PokerStars and Full Tilt Poker's argument that their operations were exempt from the UIGEA on the grounds that they offered games of skill.

This is not the first time that questions have been raised about the legality of internet gambling under federal law. In 2011, the DOJ shut down three major online poker sites, including PokerStars and Full Tilt Poker, arguing that they were operating in violation of the Wire Act, which prohibits betting or wagering over interstate communications lines. That case also made its way to the Third Circuit Court of Appeals, where it was eventually overturned on grounds that the Wire Act only applies to sports betting and does not cover other forms of gambling like poker.
