#   From college graduate to professional blackjack dealer: Heller's guide 

In 2010, I graduated college with a degree in business. I wasn't sure what I wanted to do with my life and decided to take some time off before I started graduate school. I needed a job to make some money, so I started looking into different options. 

I had always been interested in blackjack and thought it would be fun to try dealing. I found an online course that taught how to deal blackjack and decided to give it a go. It was a lot of hard work, but I eventually became a professional blackjack dealer. Here are some tips for anyone looking to become a dealer:

1) Do your research: There are a lot of different dealers' schools out there, so do your research and find the one that is best suited for you. Make sure you find one that is certified by the casinos you want to work in.

2) Get experience: Once you have completed your dealers' school, get as much experience as possible. Deal at home games, casino nights, and anywhere else you can find work. This will help improve your skills and make you more marketable when applying for jobs.

3) Network: The dealer community is a small one, so networking is key. Get to know other dealers, pit bosses, and casino staff. This will help you when it comes time to look for a job.

4) Be professional: Always act professionally both inside and outside of the casino. This includes being respectful to both players and fellow employees. Remember, you are representing the casino when you are dealing blackjack.

5) Stay up-to-date on the rules: Blackjack rules can change frequently, so be sure to stay up-to-date on the latest changes. This will help prevent any confusion while dealing and avoid any penalties from the casino management.
