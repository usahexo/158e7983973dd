#  Who was William Thackeray? 

William Thackeray was an English novelist who is best known for his satirical novels, particularly "Vanity Fair".

Born in Calcutta, India on 18 July 1811, William was the son of a British civil servant. When William was just two-years-old, his father passed away and he and his mother returned to England, where they settled in Hampshire. After completing schooling at Charterhouse, a prestigious boarding school in Surrey, William went on to study law at Cambridge University. However, he never completed his degree, instead choosing to embark on a career in journalism. 

It was in 1836 that William's journalistic career began in earnest with the publication of "The Yellowplush Correspondence" in Fraser's Magazine. This was followed by a string of other works, including "Pendennis" (1848-50), "The Newcomes" (1855) and " Vanity Fair" (1847-48), the last of which is perhaps his most famous and celebrated novel.

Although considered something of a socialite and often associated with the likes of Charles Dickens and Mrs Gaskell, William Thackeray was not without his detractors. Some accused him of being coarse and vulgar, while others felt that he lacked the depth and literary finesse of some of his contemporaries. Regardless, his novels continue to be popular more than 150 years after they were first published.

William Thackeray died from a stroke on 24 December 1863 at the age of 52.

#  What were his most famous works?

Among his most famous works are the Fifth and Ninth Symphonies, the "Moonlight" and "Waldstein" Sonatas, the Emperor Concerto, and the String Quartet No. 14 in C-sharp minor, nicknamed the "Death of a Youth."
