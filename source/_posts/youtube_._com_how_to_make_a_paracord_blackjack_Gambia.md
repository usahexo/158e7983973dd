# How to Make a Paracord Blackjack on YouTube.com

If you're looking for a fun and practical DIY project, making a paracord blackjack could be just the thing for you. A blackjack is a small, weighted club used for self-defense or in certain games. And with the added benefit of being made out of paracord, your new blackjack will also be incredibly versatile.

The best part is that you can find step-by-step instructions on how to make a paracord blackjack on YouTube.com. Here are some tips to get you started:

## Finding the Right Video

First things first, you'll want to search for a reliable video tutorial on YouTube. Look for videos that have a lot of views and positive feedback from viewers. You can also narrow down your search by adding the location, such as "Gambia," to find videos that might be more specific to your needs.

## Materials You Will Need

Once you've found a video that you like, take note of the materials needed for the project. You'll likely need paracord (about 15-20 feet), a small metal rod or pipe, a heavy object to use as the weight (such as a steel ball or lead shot), scissors, and a lighter.

## Following the Steps

The tutorial on YouTube will guide you through the process, but here's a general overview of what you can expect:

1. Cut the paracord to the appropriate length and attach it to the metal rod or pipe.
2. Create a handle by weaving the paracord around the metal rod or pipe.
3. Add the weight to the bottom of the handle.
4. Tie the paracord in a specific pattern to create the blackjack head.

Be sure to follow the steps carefully, and if you need to, pause and rewind the video to make sure you don't miss anything.

## Customizing Your Blackjack

One of the great things about making your own paracord blackjack is that you can customize it to your liking. You can choose different colors of paracord, experiment with different patterns, or add decorative knots to make it your own.

## Conclusion

Making a paracord blackjack is a fun and creative project that can also be functional. Thanks to YouTube.com, you have easy access to step-by-step tutorials that will guide you through the process. Once you've finished making your blackjack, you can feel proud of your accomplishment and even use it as a self-defense tool if necessary.
