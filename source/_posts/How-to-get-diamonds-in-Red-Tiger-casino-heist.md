1. In order to maximize your chances of getting diamonds in the Red Tiger casino heist, you first need to understand how the diamond system works. There are five different tiers of diamonds, starting with bronze and going up to diamond, with each tier containing twice as many diamonds as the one below it. You can see the breakdown of the different tiers in the image below.

As you can see, the chance of getting a diamond increases as you move up the tiers, so it’s important to aim for the higher-paying tiers if you want to maximize your profits.

2. There are a few different ways to get diamonds in Red Tiger casino heist. The most common way is by winning them in the games themselves, but you can also get them as rewards for levelling up or completing missions.

You can find out the RTP for each game by looking for the RTP percentage listed next to its name in the game lobby.

4. Not all games offer equal chances of winning diamonds, so it’s important to choose wisely which games to play. Some games have jackpots that are worth millions of pounds, while others have lower jackpots but offer much better odds of winning diamonds. It’s up to you to decide which games are worth playing based on your own goals and budget.

#  Tips and tricks on how to get diamonds in Red Tiger casino heist

The diamond is the most coveted item in any casino heist, and rightfully so. It is the symbol of wealth and extravagance, and can make or break a robbery. Here are some tips on how to get the diamonds in Red Tiger casino heist:

1. Plan your route

The quickest way to get to the diamond is usually through the back door. However, this can be risky if it's well-guarded. If you're able to get hold of a security map of the casino, it'll help you plan your route and find the quickest way to get to the diamond.

2. Use stealth

The best way to avoid getting caught is by using stealth. Make sure you know where all the security cameras and guards are, and try not to make too much noise. If possible, try to take out any security cameras or guards that may pose a threat.

3. Use distraction tactics

Another way to avoid getting caught is by using distraction tactics. This could involve creating a diversion or misleading the security guards somehow. For example, you could create a fake bomb scare or get someone to dress up as a celebrity and cause a scene.

4. Have a backup plan

No matter how well you plan your heist, there's always a chance that something may go wrong. So it's always important to have a backup plan in case things don't go as planned. This could involve having extra money on hand in case you need to make a quick escape, or having someone who can help you get out of the casino if things go south.

#  How to get diamonds faster in Red Tiger casino heist

When you're looking to get ahead in the Red Tiger casino heist, diamonds are the key. Here we'll show you three ways to get more diamonds faster, so you can progress further in the game.

1. Plan Your Heist Effectively

One of the best ways to get diamonds efficiently is to plan your heist well. Make sure you know which rooms have the diamonds and which ones don't, and take into account the guard patrols. If you can slip by undetected and grab all the diamonds in one go, you'll be set for a while.

2. Use Boosters Wisely

Another way to get ahead in the game is to use boosters effectively. Some boosters – such as the x2 multiplier – will help you get more diamonds in a shorter amount of time. Make sure you use them when it counts and you'll be raking in the gems in no time!

3. Play with Friends for Extra Rewards

Finally, another way to get extra diamonds is to play with friends on Facebook or Twitter integration. For each friend that joins your game, you'll get an extra diamond reward, so make sure to tell your friends about it!
