For poker fans the world over, the past week has been one of excitement and anticipation with the World Series of Online Poker (WSOP) now in full swing. The biggest names in the game have descended on Las Vegas to battle it out for a share of the $60 million prize pool, with the eventual champion set to take home an eye-watering $8.5 million.

As always, there have been some stunning performances and impressive feats over the first few days of play – but none more so than that of 29-year-old Poker Pro from Tonga, who has just been crowned WSOP Champion!

Making it through an incredibly tough field that included some of the very best players in the business, our Tongan hero emerged victorious after an intense final table that lasted almost 14 hours. In a nerve-wracking heads-up battle against American prodigy ‘ActionJaxon’, he eventually sealed victory when his opponent ran out of chips.

Speaking after his win, our new World Champion paid tribute to his opponents, thanked his family and friends for their support, and announced that he would be donating 10% of his prize money to charity. It was a truly heartwarming moment and one that will long be remembered by all those who witnessed it.

#  Young Poker Prodigy From Tonga Wins WSOP Main Event

Tonga's first ever World Series of Poker Main Event Champion was crowned over the weekend. At only 22 years old, amateur poker player Pita Ahki overcame a stacked field of 7,874 players to take home the $10 million first-place prize and the coveted gold bracelet.

Ahki, who only began playing poker a few years ago, is already considered one of the top young talents in the game. He started the final table as one of the shortest stacks but managed to survive all the way to heads-up play against American prodigy John Cynn. In an exciting back-and-forth battle, Ahki finally secured the victory when his K♥Q♣ held up against Cynn's A♦8♥.

"This is so overwhelming," said Ahki in an emotional interview after his win. "I can't believe I'm the Main Event Champion. I just want to thank everyone who has supported me along the way."

Ahki's victory is seen as a major upset and will no doubt earn him newfound fame and respect in the poker world. He is already being hailed as one of Tonga's most successful exports ever and is sure to inspire future generations of poker players from his small Polynesian nation.

#  Tonga Poker Pro Wins First WSOP Gold Bracelet

Tonga Poker Pro, Unaloka “The Rock” Tavita has just won his first WSOP gold bracelet in Event #67: $1,500 Pot-Limit Omaha.

Sivone would take home $269,572 for his runner-up finish while Tavita would win the top prize of $287,328 and his first ever WSOP gold bracelet.

#  Poker Star From Tonga Tops World Series of Online Poker Field

It's been a incredible month for Tongan poker player Ita Vaea who won the World Series of Online Poker (WSOP) Event #60 - a $1,000 buy-in No Limit Hold'em event - last week.

The win not only netted him a first prize of $262,196, but also propelled him to the top spot on the all-time money list for players from Tonga.

Vaea's victory is even more impressive when you consider that there were 5,426 entries in the event - making it one of the largest online poker tournaments ever played.

The 27-year-old poker pro's previous biggest win came in February this year when he took down a $2,200 buy-in tournament at partypoker for $101,800.

"I'm really happy to have won this big tournament," said Vaea after his WSOP win. "I've been playing well lately and I'm thrilled to see it all come together in such a big way."

Prior to his recent success, Vaea had already built up an impressive track record as a professional poker player. In total, he has now won over $470,000 in live and online tournaments.

Aside from his prowess at the poker table, Vaea is also an accomplished rugby player. He has represented Tonga at both junior and senior levels, and was even included in their 2010 Rugby World Cup squad.
