#  FTC Prohibits Casino from Falsely Claiming It is Legitimate

The Federal Trade Commission has ordered a casino which is based in Costa Rica to stop falsely claiming that it is a legitimate business. The order, which was announced on Monday, also requires the casino to pay a $1.3 million penalty.

According to the FTC, the casino had been making false claims about its licensing and regulatory status, as well as the legitimacy of its games. In some cases, it had even claimed that it was affiliated with or endorsed by well-known brands like Facebook and Google.

“This casino lured consumers with bogus claims about its legitimacy,” said Andrew Smith, Director of the FTC’s Bureau of Consumer Protection. “We’re shutting it down and penalizing it for its lawless conduct.”

The FTC began investigating the casino in late 2017 after receiving numerous complaints from consumers. It found that the casino was not licensed in any jurisdiction and that its games were not fair or secure. It also determined that the casino had been using fake testimonials and other deceptive marketing tactics to lure people in.

In addition to stopping its deceptive marketing practices, the order also requires the casino to pay back all of the money that it stole from consumers. This includes more than $500,000 that it earned from illegal gambling activities.

#  Nevada Regulators Crack Down on unlicensed Online Casinos

Nevada regulators have begun to crack down on unlicensed online casinos, ordering a number of them to cease and desist operations within the state.

The crackdown came as a surprise to many in the industry, as Nevada has long been one of the most permissive states when it comes to gambling. However, regulators say that they are simply trying to ensure that all casinos are playing by the same rules.

"We want to make sure that everybody is following the law," said A.G. Burnett, chairman of the Nevada Gaming Control Board. "There are certain requirements that need to be met in order to offer casino games in this state, and we will continue to enforce those regulations."

Officials say that they have been investigating unlicensed casinos for some time, and that the recent crackdown is merely the next step in their ongoing efforts to enforce state gambling regulations.

Many of the affected casinos are small operations, but there are also a few well-known names on the list, including Bovada and 5Dimes. Both of these sites have long been popular with American players, but they will now need to obtain a license from Nevada if they wish to continue operating there.

It's not clear exactly how many casinos have been ordered to cease operations, but it is believed that the number is somewhere in the dozens. The affected sites have been given a short window of time in which to comply with Nevada's regulations, or face legal action.

#  Delaware Licenses First Multi-State Online Casino

The state of Delaware has become the first in the United States to license a multi-state online casino. The new casino, which is set to launch in early 2019, will be operated by the Golden Nugget Atlantic City and offer games from both Delaware and New Jersey.

The new casino will be available to players in both states and will offer a range of popular slot titles, table games, and poker variants. In addition, players will be able to access the casino’s loyalty program, which offers perks such as discounts on hotel stays and food.

Delaware Governor John Carney Jr. heralded the new casino as a major win for the state. “This new venture positions Delaware as a national leader in this growing industry and provides our residents with more options for gaming entertainment,” he said.

The move also represents a significant coup for the Golden Nugget Atlantic City, which is looking to expand its reach beyond its home market. “This partnership puts us at the forefront of online gaming, and we are excited to offer our guests access to some of the best content available in the market,” said Tony Rodio, CEO of the Golden Nugget Atlantic City.

The launch of Delaware’s multi-state online casino comes at a time when online gambling is booming in the United States. A recent study by Eilers & Krejcik Gaming found that annual revenue from legal US online gambling will exceed $5 billion by 2020. This growth is being driven by increasing demand from consumers and more states moving to legalize online gambling.

With Delaware now leading the way, it is likely that more states will follow suit and license their own multi-state casinos in 2019.

#  California Regulator Moves to Ban Bitcoin for Gambling Purposes

The California Department of Justice (DOJ) has submitted a proposal to prohibit the use of bitcoin for gambling purposes. The proposed regulations, which are currently open for public comment, would amend the state's Criminal Code to make it illegal to gamble in bitcoin or any other cryptocurrency.

If approved, the new rules would take effect on January 1, 2019. They would apply not only to online casinos and poker rooms, but also to storefronts that sell lottery tickets or offer betting services. violators could face up to six months in jail and a $1,000 fine.

Bitcoin was originally designed as a peer-to-peer payment system, but its popularity as a virtual currency has made it a popular choice for gambling transactions. While there is no accurate way to track how much money is gambled with bitcoin, experts believe that the total amount is significant. In fact, one online casino operator has estimated that bitcoin accounted for as much as 60% of its revenue last year.

The DOJ's proposal comes amid increased scrutiny of the cryptocurrency industry by regulators worldwide. In recent months, governments in China, South Korea, and India have taken steps to crack down on bitcoin trading and investment.

#  Trump Administration Rolls Back Obama-Era Rules on Online Gambling

The Trump administration has announced the repeal of Obama-era rules on online gambling. The new regulations will allow states to decide whether they want to legalize and regulate online gambling within their borders.

The repeal was applauded by the gaming industry, which has long argued that the Obama-era rules went too far in restricting state authority. "This is a victory for the American people and for the millions of consumers who enjoy gambling in their spare time," said Geoff Freeman, president and CEO of the American Gaming Association.

The decision was denounced by opponents of online gambling, who argue that it will lead to more addiction and crime. "This is a bad day for millions of Americans who will now be at risk from shady operators," said Sarah Huckabee Sanders, White House spokesperson.

Exactly how the repeal will be implemented remains to be seen. Some states are likely to legalize online gambling, while others may choose to prohibit it altogether.
