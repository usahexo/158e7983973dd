        <h1 id="Report-Gambling-Losses-on-Schedule-A"><a href="#Report-Gambling-Losses-on-Schedule-A" class="headerlink" title="Report Gambling Losses on Schedule A"></a>Report Gambling Losses on Schedule A</h1><p>If you gambled and lost money during the year, you can report your losses on Schedule A of your tax return. This can help lower your taxable income and may reduce the amount of tax you owe.</p>
<p>To report your losses, you’ll need to know the total amount you lost during the year. You should keep records of all your gambling transactions, including the date, the amount of the bet or wager, and who you bet or wagered with.</p>
<p>You can deduct your losses up to the total amount of gambling income you reported on your return. So, if you reported $1,000 in gambling income, you can only deduct losses up to $1,000. Any excess losses cannot be carried over to future years.</p>
<p>There are a few things to keep in mind when reporting gambling losses:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Losses from illegal gambling activities are not deductible.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Gambling losses are only deductible if they are itemized deductions. So, if you take the standard deduction instead of itemizing deductions, you cannot claim your gambling losses.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Deductions for gambling losses are subject to the 2% limit for miscellaneous itemized deductions. This means that you can only deduct these expenses if they exceed 2% of your adjusted gross income (AGI).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="Can-I-Claim-Gambling-Losses-on-My-Tax-Return"><a href="#Can-I-Claim-Gambling-Losses-on-My-Tax-Return" class="headerlink" title="Can I Claim Gambling Losses on My Tax Return?"></a>Can I Claim Gambling Losses on My Tax Return?</h1><p>Yes, you can claim gambling losses on your tax return. To do so, you will need to itemize your deductions on Schedule A and report your losses as miscellaneous deductions. The total amount of your gambling losses cannot exceed the amount of your winnings, and you must have documentation to support your losses.</p>
<p>If you are a casual gambler who only gambles occasionally, your gambling losses may not be significant enough to bother claiming on your tax return. However, if you are a serious gambler or you gamble frequently, your losses could add up and result in some tax savings.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that the IRS takes a dim view of taxpayers who claim excessive gambling losses year after year. If the IRS believes that you are claiming more gambling losses than you reasonably could have incurred, it may disallow those deductions and assess penalties against you. So be sure to keep accurate records of your gambling activity and consult with a tax professional if you have any questions about how to report your losses.</p>
<h1 id="How-to-Claim-Gambling-Losses-on-Your-Taxes"><a href="#How-to-Claim-Gambling-Losses-on-Your-Taxes" class="headerlink" title="How to Claim Gambling Losses on Your Taxes"></a>How to Claim Gambling Losses on Your Taxes</h1><p>Individual taxpayers in the United States can deduct gambling losses on their taxes. This deduction is taken as an itemized deduction and is subject to certain limitations. In order to claim your gambling losses, you must keep track of all of your gambling-related expenses throughout the year.</p>
<p>If you are a regular gambler, it’s important to know how the gambling loss deduction works. Here are the basics:</p>
<p>-You can only deduct your losses if you have winnings that exceed your losses. Your net loss is limited to the amount of your winnings.</p>
<p>-Gambling losses are deductible only if you itemize deductions on your tax return.</p>
<p>-You cannot claim gambling losses for years in which you did not itemize deductions.</p>
<p>To take the deduction, you will need to keep track of all of your gambling-related expenses, including:</p>
<p>-The amount of money you lost while gambling<br>-Transportation costs to and from the casino or other gambling location<br>-Hotel rooms or other lodging costs related to gambling trips<br>-Food and beverage expenses at casinos or other gambling locations<br>-Entertainment expenses at casinos or other gambling locations<br>-Any other related expenses</p>

Here are some tips on how to deal with them:</p>
<p>-If you have gambling winnings, you need to report them as income.</p>
<p>-You can deduct gambling losses, but only up to the amount of your winnings.</p>
<p>-To claim your losses, you need to itemize your deductions on your tax return.</p>
<p>-You can’t deduct expenses like transportation costs and hotel rooms that were related to your gambling activities.</p>
<p>-If you have both gambling winnings and losses, the net result is considered taxable income.</p>
<p>These are the basics of dealing with gambling winnings and losses, but there are some other factors to consider:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Winnings from lotteries and raffles are generally not taxable, unless the prize is more than $5,000.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Gambling income includes cash prizes, but also the fair market value of all non-cash prizes, such as cars and trips.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>There are a few things to keep in mind if you have gambling income: </p>
<ol>
<li><p>You need to report it on your tax return. </p>
</li>
<li><p>Gambling income is taxable (which means you’ll pay taxes on it), unlike gambling losses which can be used to offset taxable income. </p>
</li>
<li><p>The IRS considers all forms of gambling revenue - including cash prizes, the fair market value of non-cash prizes, and even gifted money - as taxable income.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="How-to-Report-Gambling-Income-and-Expenses"><a href="#How-to-Report-Gambling-Income-and-Expenses" class="headerlink" title="How to Report Gambling Income and Expenses"></a>How to Report Gambling Income and Expenses</h1><p>If you gamble, you may have to report your gambling income and expenses on your tax return. This article explains what gambling income and expenses are, and how to report them on your tax return.</p>
<p>Gambling income includes winnings from lotteries, raffles, horse races, and casinos. It also includes cash and the fair market value of any non-cash prizes you receive. Gambling losses that exceed your gambling income can be deducted as an itemized deduction on Schedule A of your tax return.</p>
<p>To report gambling income and expenses, you will need to complete Form 1040, Schedule A. You will first report your total gambling income on Line 21 of Schedule A. Then, you will report your total gambling losses on Line 28 of Schedule A. The amount of your gambling losses that can be deducted is limited to the amount of your gambling income (i.e., you cannot deduct more than you won).</p>
<p>There are a few things to keep in mind when reporting gambling income and expenses:</p>
<p>-You must maintain accurate records of your winnings and losses. This includes documentation such as tickets, forms used to record wagers, credit card statements, etc.</p>
<p>-You cannot use personal funds to gamble or claim them as gambling losses. Gambling losses must be incurred with funds from taxable activities (e.g., wages, self-employment income, etc.).</p>
<p>-Gambling income is taxable regardless of whether it is reported on your return or not.</p>
<p>Reporting gambling income and expenses can be confusing, so if you have any questions please consult a qualified accountant or tax professional.</p>

But they also come with risks. Here are some tips for protecting yourself when visiting an illegal casino.</p>
<p>-Be aware of the risks. Illegitimate casinos may be less safe than legitimate ones. They may not have proper security measures in place, and they may not follow gambling regulations. This means that you could be at risk of theft or other crimes while visiting an illegal casino.</p>
<p>-Don’t gamble more than you can afford to lose. Illegal casinos are often unlicensed and unregulated, which means that they may not offer the same protections as legitimate casinos. So if something goes wrong while you’re gambling, you may not have any legal recourse. It’s important to remember that the house always has an edge in casino games, so don’t gamble more than you can afford to lose.</p>
<p>-Make sure your computer is secure. When visiting an illegal casino, it’s important to make sure your computer is secure. Avoid using public WiFi hotspots, and make sure your anti-virus software is up-to-date. Also, be careful about revealing personal information while on the casino website.</p>

        <h1 id="FTC-Prohibits-Casino-from-Falsely-Claiming-It-is-Legitimate"><a href="#FTC-Prohibits-Casino-from-Falsely-Claiming-It-is-Legitimate" class="headerlink" title="FTC Prohibits Casino from Falsely Claiming It is Legitimate"></a>FTC Prohibits Casino from Falsely Claiming It is Legitimate</h1><p>The Federal Trade Commission has ordered a casino which is based in Costa Rica to stop falsely claiming that it is a legitimate business. The order, which was announced on Monday, also requires the casino to pay a $1.3 million penalty.</p>
<p>According to the FTC, the casino had been making false claims about its licensing and regulatory status, as well as the legitimacy of its games. In some cases, it had even claimed that it was affiliated with or endorsed by well-known brands like Facebook and Google.</p>
<p>“This casino lured consumers with bogus claims about its legitimacy,” said Andrew Smith, Director of the FTC’s Bureau of Consumer Protection. “We’re shutting it down and penalizing it for its lawless conduct.”</p>
<p>The FTC began investigating the casino in late 2017 after receiving numerous complaints from consumers. It found that the casino was not licensed in any jurisdiction and that its games were not fair or secure. It also determined that the casino had been using fake testimonials and other deceptive marketing tactics to lure people in.</p>
<p>In addition to stopping its deceptive marketing practices, the order also requires the casino to pay back all of the money that it stole from consumers. This includes more than $500,000 that it earned from illegal gambling activities.</p>
<h1 id="Nevada-Regulators-Crack-Down-on-unlicensed-Online-Casinos"><a href="#Nevada-Regulators-Crack-Down-on-unlicensed-Online-Casinos" class="headerlink" title="Nevada Regulators Crack Down on unlicensed Online Casinos"></a>Nevada Regulators Crack Down on unlicensed Online Casinos</h1><p>Nevada regulators have begun to crack down on unlicensed online casinos, ordering a number of them to cease and desist operations within the state.</p>
<p>The crackdown came as a surprise to many in the industry, as Nevada has long been one of the most permissive states when it comes to gambling. However, regulators say that they are simply trying to ensure that all casinos are playing by the same rules.</p>
<p>“We want to make sure that everybody is following the law,” said A.G. Burnett, chairman of the Nevada Gaming Control Board. “There are certain requirements that need to be met in order to offer casino games in this state, and we will continue to enforce those regulations.”</p>
<p>Officials say that they have been investigating unlicensed casinos for some time, and that the recent crackdown is merely the next step in their ongoing efforts to enforce state gambling regulations.</p>
<p>Many of the affected casinos are small operations, but there are also a few well-known names on the list, including Bovada and 5Dimes. Both of these sites have long been popular with American players, but they will now need to obtain a license from Nevada if they wish to continue operating there.</p>
<p>It’s not clear exactly how many casinos have been ordered to cease operations, but it is believed that the number is somewhere in the dozens. The affected sites have been given a short window of time in which to comply with Nevada’s regulations, or face legal action.</p>
<h1 id="Delaware-Licenses-First-Multi-State-Online-Casino"><a href="#Delaware-Licenses-First-Multi-State-Online-Casino" class="headerlink" title="Delaware Licenses First Multi-State Online Casino"></a>Delaware Licenses First Multi-State Online Casino</h1><p>The state of Delaware has become the first in the United States to license a multi-state online casino. The new casino, which is set to launch in early 2019, will be operated by the Golden Nugget Atlantic City and offer games from both Delaware and New Jersey.</p>
<p>The new casino will be available to players in both states and will offer a range of popular slot titles, table games, and poker variants. In addition, players will be able to access the casino’s loyalty program, which offers perks such as discounts on hotel stays and food.</p>
<p>Delaware Governor John Carney Jr. heralded the new casino as a major win for the state. “This new venture positions Delaware as a national leader in this growing industry and provides our residents with more options for gaming entertainment,” he said.</p>
<p>The move also represents a significant coup for the Golden Nugget Atlantic City, which is looking to expand its reach beyond its home market. “This partnership puts us at the forefront of online gaming, and we are excited to offer our guests access to some of the best content available in the market,” said Tony Rodio, CEO of the Golden Nugget Atlantic City.</p>
<p>The launch of Delaware’s multi-state online casino comes at a time when online gambling is booming in the United States. A recent study by Eilers &amp; Krejcik Gaming found that annual revenue from legal US online gambling will exceed $5 billion by 2020. This growth is being driven by increasing demand from consumers and more states moving to legalize online gambling.</p>
<p>With Delaware now leading the way, it is likely that more states will follow suit and license their own multi-state casinos in 2019.</p>
<h1 id="California-Regulator-Moves-to-Ban-Bitcoin-for-Gambling-Purposes"><a href="#California-Regulator-Moves-to-Ban-Bitcoin-for-Gambling-Purposes" class="headerlink" title="California Regulator Moves to Ban Bitcoin for Gambling Purposes"></a>California Regulator Moves to Ban Bitcoin for Gambling Purposes</h1><p>The California Department of Justice (DOJ) has submitted a proposal to prohibit the use of bitcoin for gambling purposes. The proposed regulations, which are currently open for public comment, would amend the state’s Criminal Code to make it illegal to gamble in bitcoin or any other cryptocurrency.</p>
<p>If approved, the new rules would take effect on January 1, 2019. They would apply not only to online casinos and poker rooms, but also to storefronts that sell lottery tickets or offer betting services. violators could face up to six months in jail and a $1,000 fine.</p>
<p>Bitcoin was originally designed as a peer-to-peer payment system, but its popularity as a virtual currency has made it a popular choice for gambling transactions. While there is no accurate way to track how much money is gambled with bitcoin, experts believe that the total amount is significant. In fact, one online casino operator has estimated that bitcoin accounted for as much as 60% of its revenue last year.</p>
<p>The DOJ’s proposal comes amid increased scrutiny of the cryptocurrency industry by regulators worldwide. In recent months, governments in China, South Korea, and India have taken steps to crack down on bitcoin trading and investment.</p>
<h1 id="Trump-Administration-Rolls-Back-Obama-Era-Rules-on-Online-Gambling"><a href="#Trump-Administration-Rolls-Back-Obama-Era-Rules-on-Online-Gambling" class="headerlink" title="Trump Administration Rolls Back Obama-Era Rules on Online Gambling"></a>Trump Administration Rolls Back Obama-Era Rules on Online Gambling</h1><p>The Trump administration has announced the repeal of Obama-era rules on online gambling. The new regulations will allow states to decide whether they want to legalize and regulate online gambling within their borders.</p>
<p>The repeal was applauded by the gaming industry, which has long argued that the Obama-era rules went too far in restricting state authority. “This is a victory for the American people and for the millions of consumers who enjoy gambling in their spare time,” said Geoff Freeman, president and CEO of the American Gaming Association.</p>
<p>The decision was denounced by opponents of online gambling, who argue that it will lead to more addiction and crime. “This is a bad day for millions of Americans who will now be at risk from shady operators,” said Sarah Huckabee Sanders, White House spokesperson.</p>
<p>Exactly how the repeal will be implemented remains to be seen. Some states are likely to legalize online gambling, while others may choose to prohibit it altogether.</p>

        <h1 id="What-is-a-casino-floor-and-what-does-it-runnet-1XBET"><a href="#What-is-a-casino-floor-and-what-does-it-runnet-1XBET" class="headerlink" title="What is a casino floor and what does it runnet 1XBET?"></a>What is a casino floor and what does it runnet 1XBET?</h1><p>Casino floors are the most prominent sections of a casino, typically located on the main gaming level. A casino floor contains all of the gaming machines and tables in the casino, and is open to the public. Most casinos also have a non-smoking section, as well as a high-roller area for more elite guests.</p>
<p>The primary function of a casino floor is to house gambling devices and games. The layout of a casino floor is typically designed to encourage gambling, with games grouped together and easy access to ATMs, restaurants, and other amenities.</p>
<p>A casino floor is also home to security personnel and surveillance cameras. Staff members monitoring the casino floor are responsible for maintaining order, ensuring that players follow the rules, and responding to any emergencies that may arise.</p>
<h1 id="How-to-get-on-the-casino-floor-runnet-1XBET"><a href="#How-to-get-on-the-casino-floor-runnet-1XBET" class="headerlink" title="How to get on the casino floor runnet 1XBET"></a>How to get on the casino floor runnet 1XBET</h1><p>Casinos offer games of chance and excitement to their guests. But most people don’t know how to get on the casino floor. If you are looking to play some table games or slots, follow these steps to get on the casino floor.</p>
<p>#1: Know What You Are Looking for</p>
<p>Before you go to the casino, research what games you want to play. Each casino offers different games, so knowing what you want will help narrow down your choices. There are many different table games, such as blackjack, roulette, craps, and poker. Or if you prefer slots, there are thousands of machines with different themes and bonus rounds.</p>
<p>#2: Choose a Casino</p>
<p>There are many casinos across the country. Decide which one is closest to you or has the games that you want to play. Most casinos have websites with information about their amenities and what games they offer. You can also read reviews online from other players before making your decision.</p>
<p>#3: Go During Non-peak Hours</p>
<p>The best time to go to a casino is during off-peak hours. This way you won’t have to wait in line to get onto the casino floor and you can find a seat at your desired game table more easily. Peak hours are usually Friday and Saturday nights, so try going on a weekday or Sunday evening instead.</p>
<p>#4: Dress Code<br>A lot of people wonder what the dress code is for casinos. There is no specific dress code, but most people dress casually. Shorts, jeans, and t-shirts are all acceptable attire in most casinos. Just make sure that you are well- groomed and not wearing anything too revealing or baggy clothes that could get in the way of your game play.</p>
<p>#5: Know Your Limits<br>When gambling, it is important to set limits for yourself and stick to them. Decide how much money you are willing to spend at the casino and when you want to stop playing. This will help avoid any financial problems down the road.</p>
<h1 id="What-are-the-benefits-of-being-on-the-casino-floor-runnet-1XBET"><a href="#What-are-the-benefits-of-being-on-the-casino-floor-runnet-1XBET" class="headerlink" title="What are the benefits of being on the casino floor runnet 1XBET?"></a>What are the benefits of being on the casino floor runnet 1XBET?</h1><ol>
<li><p>There are a number of benefits that come with being on the casino floor. Perhaps the most obvious benefit is that you have access to all of the games that are available at the casino. This can provide you with hours of entertainment, and it also gives you a chance to try out a variety of different games.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Another big benefit of being on the casino floor is that you can win some serious money. There are many high-paying games available at casinos, and if you are lucky, you could walk away with a huge jackpot.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Additionally, casinos often offer great rewards programs that can provide you with plenty of perks. These rewards programs can include free meals, free hotel stays, and even free cash.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Finally, being on the casino floor can be a lot of fun. The atmosphere is always exciting, and there is always something going on. If you are looking for a fun night out, then visiting a casino is a great option.</p>
</li>

<h1 id="How-to-make-the-most-of-your-casino-floor-runnet-1XBET"><a href="#How-to-make-the-most-of-your-casino-floor-runnet-1XBET" class="headerlink" title="How to make the most of your casino floor runnet 1XBET"></a>How to make the most of your casino floor runnet 1XBET</h1><p>When playing at a casino, the goal is to score as many wins as possible and walk away with some extra cash. However, the reality is that most casino players don’t win very often. In fact, the vast majority of casino patrons lose money in the long run. So, how can you make the most of your casino floor runnet and increase your chances of winning?</p>
<ol>
<li>Have a plan</li>
</ol>
<p>One of the biggest mistakes that people make when they play at a casino is that they don’t have any strategy or plan. They just wing it, which almost always leads to disaster. Instead, come up with a plan before you even step foot on the casino floor. This could involve picking certain games to play or betting amounts, among other things.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Don’t bet more than you can afford to lose</li>
</ol>
<p>Another common mistake that people make is that they bet more money than they can afford to lose. This is a recipe for disaster, as you’re likely to end up losing more money than you intended. It’s important to set strict limits on how much money you’re willing to gamble and stick to those limits.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Don’t chase your losses</li>
</ol>
<p>One of the worst things that you can do when playing at a casino is chasing your losses. This means continuing to bet more money in an effort to win back what you’ve already lost. Not only is this strategy unlikely to work, but it can also lead to financial ruin. If you find yourself in this situation, it’s best to walk away and come back another day.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Choose games wisely</li>
</ol>
<p>Not all games are created equal when it comes to odds of winning. It’s important to choose games that offer favourable odds if you want increase your chances of coming out ahead. Some of the better options include blackjack, craps and roulette. Avoid games like slot machines, which tend to have very poor odds for players.</p>
<h1 id="What-else-can-you-do-on-the-casino-floor-runnet-1XBET"><a href="#What-else-can-you-do-on-the-casino-floor-runnet-1XBET" class="headerlink" title="What else can you do on the casino floor runnet 1XBET?"></a>What else can you do on the casino floor runnet 1XBET?</h1><p>There are a few other things you can do while on the casino floor. You can play arcade games, bet on sports, and visit the restaurants and bars.</p>
<p>Arcade Games</p>
<p>If you’re looking for some arcade excitement, the casino floor has you covered. There are a variety of games to choose from, including classics like Pac-Man and newer games like Fruit Ninja. Some casinos even have games that let you race against other players for big prizes. So if you’re feeling competitive, the arcade section is definitely worth checking out.</p>
<p>Sports Betting</p>
<p>Another popular activity on the casino floor is sports betting. If there’s a big game going on, you can place a bet and see how well you do. Sports betting can be a lot of fun, and it’s also a great way to make some extra money. So if you’re interested in giving it a try, the casino is definitely the place to do it.</p>
<p>Restaurants and Bars</p>
<p>Of course, no trip to the casino would be complete without visiting one of its restaurants or bars. There’s something for everyone here, whether you’re in the mood for Italian food or sushi. And if you want to keep the party going after dinner, there are plenty of bars to choose from. So whatever your taste may be, the casino has you covered.</p>

It’s always a lot of fun, and we always seem to come home with some new clothes or a little bit of extra cash.</p>
<p>Of course, the best part about it is that we never have to spend any money to have a good time. We simply use our rewards cards to get free slot play, and then we enjoy spending the afternoon playing our favorite games.</p>
<p>We’ve been doing this for years now, and it’s always been a lot of fun. We never know what we’ll find when we go shopping, but that’s part of the appeal. And, even though the casino can be a little bit noisy, we enjoy the excitement of the slots machines.</p>
<p>We’re always happy when we manage to win a few bucks, but we’re just as happy when we walk away with nothing more than a few new outfits. Either way, it’s always a lot of fun, and we plan to keep doing it for years to come!</p>
<h1 id="We-Love-to-Shop-and-Play-Slot-Machines-for-Free"><a href="#We-Love-to-Shop-and-Play-Slot-Machines-for-Free" class="headerlink" title="We Love to Shop and Play Slot Machines for Free!"></a>We Love to Shop and Play Slot Machines for Free!</h1><p>We love to shop and play slot machines for free, but who doesn’t? It’s a great way to spend an afternoon or evening. Plus, it doesn’t cost anything to play.</p>
<p>There are several places near our house where we can shop and play slot machines for free. One is a small shopping center about a mile from our house. It has several stores, including a grocery store, convenience store, and pharmacy. There is also a small casino in the shopping center with about a dozen slot machines.</p>
<p>Another place where we can shop and play slot machines for free is the casino in our town. It’s not very big, but it has several restaurants, a few shops, and about 100 slot machines. We can also play table games there for free, but we haven’t tried that yet.</p>
<p>Finally, there are several casinos about an hour’s drive from our house. We’ve only been to one of them so far, but we plan to visit more soon. They all have large casinos with lots of slot machines and table games. And best of all, you can gamble for free at most of them!</p>
<p>So if you’re looking for something fun to do, why not try shopping and playing slot machines for free? You might just find your new favorite pastime!</p>

We just go to the casino, find the nearest machine, and start playing. We never spend any money on these games, and we always have a lot of fun.</p>
<p>One thing that we really love about playing slot machines for free is that there is no pressure to win. We can just relax and have a good time, without worrying about whether or not we are going to come out ahead. This is a great way to take a break from the real world and have some fun.</p>
<p>Another thing that we like about playing slot machines for free is that there is always something new to try. Whether we are playing a traditional slot machine or one of the newer multi-line games, we never get bored. There are so many different combinations of symbols that can result in winning combinations, so each game is a new challenge.</p>
<p>Finally, playing slot machines for free is a great way to improve our skills. We can learn which symbols pay out the most frequently, how to time our bets correctly, and which bonus rounds are the most lucrative. This information will help us when we do start playing for money.</p>

They are also commonly found in game rooms and home entertainment centers. Some arcade games are based on video games, while others use physical objects or mechanisms.</p>
<h1 id="History"><a href="#History" class="headerlink" title="History"></a>History</h1><p>The first popular arcade games were electronic games that used a cathode ray tube display to create a vector-based image. These early arcade games included Atari’s 1978 hit Space Invaders, followed soon by Asteroids, Centipede and Missile Command. In 1980, Pac-Man was introduced and became an international sensation. These early video games were played on standard television sets. By 1981, the arcade video game industry was worth an estimated $8 billion annually.[1]</p>
<p>In the late 1970s and early 1980s, arcade game developers had to write their own software code, as no off-the-shelf game engines were available. This was due to the high cost and limited computing power of early arcade hardware. In some cases, necessary programming tasks were done by design engineers or graphic artists, including Jeff Minter (Llamatron), Tim Skelly (Asteroids), Dave Theurer (Tempest) and Eugene Jarvis (Defender).</p>
<p>During the 1990s, personal computers began to catch up with arcade machines in terms of capabilities, resulting in a decline in interest in arcade games.[2] Various factors led to the eventual demise of the traditional American arcade with its big cabinet games: cheaper home versions of these same games became available; consumers preferred consoles which could be used at home; issue Arcades began to feel dirty and unsafe following years of neglect from their owners;[3][4] the increasing rarity of classic Atari 2600&#x2F;5200&#x2F;7800 carts made them valuable collectors items both for gamers and shady business types,[5][6] etc. There are still many dedicated gaming arcades around the world however, especially in Japan as well as Europe.[7]</p>
<p>Arcade gaming has seen a slight resurgence in popularity since about 2005 thanks to cheaper LCD monitors and better graphics cards that allow for more immersive gaming experiences at reasonable prices;[8][9][10] this has led to new “arcade bars” being opened that offer classic as well as new titles. cabinets suffer from reliability problems due to their age and complexity. Wiring becomes brittle over time and connectors can corrode; mechanical parts wear out or become seized up; tracking balls can get dirty or dusty so they don’t provide accurate results; capacitors may dry up if Arcade cabinets have not been regularly used</p>
