<p>The two sides avoided arbitration on February 10, 2015, agreeing to a one-year, $5.25 million contract. Hosmer went on to win his first Gold Glove Award and Silver Slugger Award at first base that season. </p>
<p>On December 8, 2017, Hosmer signed an eight-year contract with the San Diego Padres worth $144 million. </p>

<p>The move is part of an effort by Major League Baseball to increase fan engagement and make games more exciting. It also comes at a time when sports betting is becoming increasingly popular across the United States.</p>
<p>“This partnership provides our fans with another way to engage with Royals baseball and adds an extra level of excitement to our games,” said Kansas City Royals president Dan Glass in a statement.</p>
<p>William Hill US, which is the American affiliate of British bookmaker William Hill, already has partnerships with about two dozen other MLB teams. The company plans to offer in-game betting for all 30 teams this season.</p>
