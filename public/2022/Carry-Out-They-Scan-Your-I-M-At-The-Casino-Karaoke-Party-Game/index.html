They are also commonly found in game rooms and home entertainment centers. Some arcade games are based on video games, while others use physical objects or mechanisms.</p>
<h1 id="History"><a href="#History" class="headerlink" title="History"></a>History</h1><p>The first popular arcade games were electronic games that used a cathode ray tube display to create a vector-based image. These early arcade games included Atari’s 1978 hit Space Invaders, followed soon by Asteroids, Centipede and Missile Command. In 1980, Pac-Man was introduced and became an international sensation. These early video games were played on standard television sets. By 1981, the arcade video game industry was worth an estimated $8 billion annually.[1]</p>
<p>In the late 1970s and early 1980s, arcade game developers had to write their own software code, as no off-the-shelf game engines were available. This was due to the high cost and limited computing power of early arcade hardware. In some cases, necessary programming tasks were done by design engineers or graphic artists, including Jeff Minter (Llamatron), Tim Skelly (Asteroids), Dave Theurer (Tempest) and Eugene Jarvis (Defender).</p>
<p>During the 1990s, personal computers began to catch up with arcade machines in terms of capabilities, resulting in a decline in interest in arcade games.[2] Various factors led to the eventual demise of the traditional American arcade with its big cabinet games: cheaper home versions of these same games became available; consumers preferred consoles which could be used at home; issue Arcades began to feel dirty and unsafe following years of neglect from their owners;[3][4] the increasing rarity of classic Atari 2600&#x2F;5200&#x2F;7800 carts made them valuable collectors items both for gamers and shady business types,[5][6] etc. There are still many dedicated gaming arcades around the world however, especially in Japan as well as Europe.[7]</p>
<p>Arcade gaming has seen a slight resurgence in popularity since about 2005 thanks to cheaper LCD monitors and better graphics cards that allow for more immersive gaming experiences at reasonable prices;[8][9][10] this has led to new “arcade bars” being opened that offer classic as well as new titles. cabinets suffer from reliability problems due to their age and complexity. Wiring becomes brittle over time and connectors can corrode; mechanical parts wear out or become seized up; tracking balls can get dirty or dusty so they don’t provide accurate results; capacitors may dry up if Arcade cabinets have not been regularly used</p>
