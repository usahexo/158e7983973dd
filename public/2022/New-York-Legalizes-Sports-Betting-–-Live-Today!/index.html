<p>Governor Andrew M. Cuomo, a Democrat, signed the law authorizing sports betting on Sunday evening. It allows wagers at casinos and on mobile apps, with the tax revenue shared by the state and its localities.</p>
<p>“The big game is coming up this weekend, so it’s perfect timing,” Mr. Cuomo said in a news release. “This new law will bring nearly a billion dollars in economic activity and thousands of jobs to New York over the next seven years, and it supports our efforts to re-energize upstate gaming facilities.”</p>
<p>New Yorkers can place bets starting at 6:00 a.m. on Monday at four upstate commercial casinos that have been authorized to offer sports betting: del Lago Resort &amp; Casino in Waterloo; Tioga Downs Casino Resort in Nichols; Rivers Casino &amp; Resort Schenectady; and Resorts World Catskills in Monticello. Bets will also be accepted through mobile apps offered by those casinos.</p>
<p>Residents of other states will not be able to place bets with those casinos, but they could do so if they traveled to New York State.</p>
<p>The legislation authorizing sports betting was passed by the State Legislature last month as part of a broader package of bills aimed at increasing tourism and economic development Upstate. In addition to authorizing sports betting, that package included measures to allow ridesharing services like Uber and Lyft outside of New York City and create tax breaks for manufacturers who expand or relocate to Upstate New York.</p>
<p>Other states that have legalized sports betting this year include Delaware, Mississippi, New Jersey and West Virginia. Connecticut and Pennsylvania are expected to follow suit soon.</p>
<h1 id="NY-Sports-Bettors-Can-Finally-Place-Bets-at-Local-Bookies"><a href="#NY-Sports-Bettors-Can-Finally-Place-Bets-at-Local-Bookies" class="headerlink" title="NY Sports Bettors Can Finally Place Bets at Local Bookies"></a>NY Sports Bettors Can Finally Place Bets at Local Bookies</h1><p>The end of the NFL lockout means one thing for sports bettors in New York - they can finally place bets at their local bookies. The Sports Wagering Consumer Protection and Enforcement Act, which went into effect on September 1, lifted the ban on sports betting in the state.</p>
<p>Prior to the act, residents of New York could only bet on sports through off-shore websites, which often have less favorable odds and worse customer service than local bookies. Now that residents are free to place bets with their neighborhood bookie, many are expecting a big boost to the local economy.</p>
<p>“This is great news for our town,” said Joe Bookie, owner of Joe’s Sportbook in Albany. “My business was really suffering because of the lockout. Now I’m expecting a surge in traffic as people flock to my shop to make their bets.”</p>
<p>In addition to boosting local businesses, experts believe that the legalization of sports betting will also create jobs and generate tax revenue for New York State. “This is a huge win for the state,” said Assemblyman Gary Pretlow, who sponsored the bill that legalized sports betting. “We’re looking at millions of dollars in new revenue that can be used to support important programs like education and infrastructure.”</p>
<p>So far, most New Yorkers seem to be embracing the change. “I’ve been waiting for years for this day,” said Mike Hunchback, a lifelong Giants fan from Rochester. “I can’t wait to get down to Joe’s Sportbook and start betting on my team.”</p>
<p>Whether you’re a seasoned pro or a complete novice when it comes to betting on sports, now is the perfect time to get involved in the action. With the NFL season in full swing and college football just around the corner, there’s plenty of great matchups ahead that are sure to produce some winning bets. So visit your local bookie today and get started!</p>
<h1 id="When-Does-My-Bookie-in-New-York-Open-for-Business"><a href="#When-Does-My-Bookie-in-New-York-Open-for-Business" class="headerlink" title="When Does My Bookie in New York Open for Business?"></a>When Does My Bookie in New York Open for Business?</h1><p>The eastern United States is home to many different states, each of which has its own regulations and laws. This can make it difficult to determine when exactly your bookie in New York is open for business. The following provides a general overview of the gambling laws in New York and when you can expect your local bookie to be up and running.</p>
<h1 id="Gambling-Laws-in-New-York"><a href="#Gambling-Laws-in-New-York" class="headerlink" title="Gambling Laws in New York"></a>Gambling Laws in New York</h1><p>The state of New York has a complex history with gambling. The first lottery was held in the state back in 1768, and horse racing was legalized in 1894. However, most forms of gambling were outlawed in 1907. It wasn’t until 1957 that pari-mutuel betting was once again made legal in the state.</p>
<p>New York’s current gambling laws can be summarized as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Gambling is only allowed if conducted by the state lottery or through authorized gaming clubs</p>
</li>
<li><p>Slot machines are only allowed at racetracks and other authorized locations</p>
</li>
<li><p>bet on races at authorized venues only </p>
</li>
<li><p>Poker and other card games are allowed at casinos and social clubs, but only if no money is exchanged between players</p>
</li>
<li><p>There are no laws prohibiting online gambling, but no specific laws regulating it either</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Based on these regulations, it appears that New York residents are free to wager on sports events so long as they do so at an authorized venue. Your local bookie will likely be open for business around the time of major sporting events such as the Super Bowl, World Series, or NBA Finals.</p>

So, when can you start betting on sports in New York? The answer: it depends.</p>
<p>For traditional sports betting, you must be 21 years old and located in one of the four upstate counties: Erie, Livingston, Ontario, or Schuyler. As of now, there are no brick-and-mortar sportsbooks in these counties; you must place your bets online or over the phone.</p>
<p>Mobile sports betting is a bit different. You must be 18 years old to bet, and you can do so from any location in the state. There are currently six authorized mobile Sportsbook apps in New York: DraftKings, FanDuel, PointsBet, BetStars, William Hill US, and SugarHouse Casino.</p>

<h1 id="Get-Ready-New-York-Sports-Wagering-is-now-legal"><a href="#Get-Ready-New-York-Sports-Wagering-is-now-legal" class="headerlink" title="Get Ready, New York! Sports Wagering is now legal!"></a>Get Ready, New York! Sports Wagering is now legal!</h1><p>On Tuesday, May 14, 2019, sports betting finally became legal in the state of New York. The long-awaited news was celebrated by many, as this new form of gambling will now be available at licensed venues across the state.</p>
<p>For those who are unfamiliar with the concept, sports betting is exactly what it sounds like – wagering on the outcomes of sporting events. In most cases, this involves placing a bet on either the winner or loser of a particular matchup. However, there are other types of bets that can be placed as well, such as predicting how many points will be scored in a game or which team will score first.</p>
<p>While sports betting has been legal in other parts of the country for many years now, New York has been slow to catch up. This is largely due to the fact that the state has been trying to figure out how to best regulate and tax the newly legalized industry. However, after months of deliberation, officials finally came up with a plan that they feel satisfies both needs.</p>
<p>Under the new regulations, only licensed venues will be able to offer sports betting services. In order to obtain a license, these venues will have to pay a fee of $100,000 per year. They will also be required to abide by certain rules and regulations, such as prohibiting anyone under 21 from placing a bet.</p>
<p>In addition to paying the licensing fee, venues will also have to shell out 35% of their net revenue from sports betting operations to the state government. This money will be used to fund various programs, such as education and addiction prevention initiatives.</p>
<p>While some people may see this tax as excessive, officials felt that it was necessary in order to help offset any potential negative impacts that sports betting may have on society. As New York State Governor Andrew Cuomo stated: “We want to make sure that our communities are healthy and safe and this is part of that process.”</p>
<p>So far, it appears that most New Yorkers are in favor of the new regulations. In a recent poll commissioned by Siena College Institute for Public Affairs, 64% of respondents said that they supported legalizing sports betting in the state. This is likely due to the fact that many people view it as a way to generate additional revenue for local businesses and government coffers alike.</p>
<p>It should be noted that not everyone is happy about New York’s decision to legalize sports betting. Some opponents argue that it could lead to an increase in gambling addiction rates and other social ills. However, so far there is no evidence that this is actually happening anywhere else where sports betting is legal.</p>
<p>At any rate, it appears that New York is ready for its close-up when it comes to legalized sports gambling!</p>
